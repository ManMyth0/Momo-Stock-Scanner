*Temporary, will change the format and add full descriptions later*

**This is a free to use stock scanning tool, that will produce formatted and filtered company news based on a scalping type trading strategy.

**The project will be a full stack combination with the front end organizing the information categorically

**The goal is to utilize free News and Company Information APIs to produce a steady flow of stock symbol / ticker news and needed company information such as:
    -Company's Floating Interest
    -Current Price
    -Percent Gained (since market open time )
    -Daily Relative Volume
    -Saving momentum information to the database to be returned upon certain conditions

***Currently, the backend is still in production and fetches, filters and formats news information with added functionality upon failure or API Call limits being reached.
   as well as obtaining the company's Float Value. More to come...
